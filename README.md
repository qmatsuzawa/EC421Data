# Overview
This repository includes data (both simulated & publically available ones) that I will be using for my ec421 course. The idea for this repository is so that students can just import their data from a server and not worry about downloading, setting directory when importing datasets.

# Datasets

### Starwars
Basically the starwars data in ``tidyverse``, but I filtered some missing numeric values, so students don't have to worry about setting na.rm=TRUE when doing numeric analysis.

### CASchools
Basically the CASchools data in ``AER``, but with another new column (teacher-student ratio).
